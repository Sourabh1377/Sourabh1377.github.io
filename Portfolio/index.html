<p>Hi! Welcome to my portfolio website. I am a Technical Support Specialist currently residing in Vancouver, BC, Canada. My journey in Canada started when I came in 2019 as a student. I went to Kwantlen Polytechnic University (KPU),
 Surrey, BC, and did a high school diploma in Computer Information Systems. Till grade 12, I did my schooling from India and after that I decided to continue my studies in Canada. <br><br>
As I was studying in KPU, I got to explore various areas of Information technology
including, Software Developement, Networking, Web-development, Hardware and Software troubleshooting, Operating Systems and so on. Although I have not decided which of these areas I want to build my career in, but the experience from KPU helped me find two areas that
I like the most: Software Development and Hardware-Software troubleshooting. And that's the reason, I went on to find a job as a Technical Support Specialist in which I help other users having difficulties with their devices/programs. A fun fact about my job is that everyday there is 
a new challenge as users keep coming across different problems and finding the solutions is what entertains me. <br><br>

Not only this, the experince I gained from my previous jobs also helped me to decide that I will give this area of Information Technology (Troubleshooting) one try and see how interesting I find it. I started my work career as a Cashier/Customer Service Representative
in Shoppers Drug Mart. This job taught me some important skills like addressing customer issues, dealing with people, working in a team. After this, my role as a Tech-Specialist and Service Technician at London Drugs helped me to use my technical knowledge and guide people while
purchasing any tech item. As a Service Technician, I learned the proper "Troubleshooting theory", Communicating with "Not-So-Techy" people without using any technical jargon.
